		# Talking Villagers configuration.
		#
		# ===========================================================================
		#  Setting up Ollama
		#
		#  Villagers speak using a language model you run yourself. Nothing is sent
		#  to any external service, and the mod never blocks the server waiting on
		#  it: if the model is slow or missing, villagers just go quiet.
		#
		#  1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/download
		#     Linux:  curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
		#
		#  2. Download a model. A 3B model is what this mod is tuned for:
		#         ollama pull llama3.2:3b
		#     See what you already have with:
		#         ollama list
		#     The "model" setting below must match a name from that list exactly,
		#     including the tag after the colon.
		#
		#  3. Make sure Ollama is running. It usually starts with your computer and
		#     listens on port 11434. If it is not running, start it with:
		#         ollama serve
		#     Check it is up:
		#         curl http://localhost:11434
		#     A working server answers "Ollama is running".
		#
		#  4. If Ollama is on the SAME machine as the Minecraft server, the default
		#     base_url below already works. There is nothing else to do.
		#
		#  5. If Ollama is on a DIFFERENT machine, it refuses outside connections
		#     until told otherwise. On the machine running Ollama, set the
		#     environment variable
		#         OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0
		#     restart Ollama, allow port 11434 through that machine's firewall, and
		#     then point base_url at its address, for example
		#         base_url = "http://192.168.1.50:11434"
		#
		#  6. Start the Minecraft server and walk up to a village. The mod adds no
		#     commands at all - everything it does happens by playing: sneak-click
		#     a villager to talk to them, or sneak-click them (or a village bell)
		#     with a plain book to be handed a written record. The server log says
		#     whether Ollama could be reached.
		#
		#  Troubleshooting
		#     The log says Ollama is not responding
		#         Ollama is not running, or base_url has the wrong host or port.
		#         Test it with the curl command in step 3.
		#     Villagers never say anything
		#         The model name probably does not match "ollama list", or the model
		#         is still downloading. The server log says which it is.
		#     Replies take too long to appear
		#         The model is too big for the hardware. Try a smaller one, or raise
		#         timeout_ms.
		#     Everything worked and then stopped
		#         Nothing to do. The mod re-checks Ollama every
		#         health_check_interval_ticks and villagers resume on their own.
